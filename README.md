# Project (INTERNSHIP)
**🛒 E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis**<br><br>

**📌 Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting product return behavior in an e-commerce setting. Using real-world data from the UCI Online Retail dataset, it aims to identify patterns behind high return rates and build a predictive model to assess return risk. The insights are visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard.<br><br>

**🎯 Objectives**
- Analyze return behavior by product, region, and time.
- Predict probability of return using logistic regression.
- Identify high-risk products and orders for preemptive action.
- Build an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.<br><br>

| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn) | Data analysis and modeling     |
| SQLite                                             | Lightweight SQL querying       |
| Power BI                                           | Interactive dashboard creation |
| Jupyter Notebook                                   | Development environment        |<br><br>

**🛠 Key Steps**
1. Data Cleaning
Removed canceled and incomplete records

Created features: order_value, Month, return_flag

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualized return rates by country, product, and time

Identified top-returned items and trends

5. SQL Analysis (SQLite)
Grouped return behavior by category, month, country

6. Logistic Regression Modeling
Trained a logistic model to predict return probability

Output: risk_score

5. Power BI Dashboard
KPIs: Total returns, high-risk orders, return rate

Charts: Return risk by country, product, month

Table: High-risk orders with filters <br><br>

**📊 Deliverables**

 Cleaned dataset 

 High-risk predictions 

 Interactive dashboard <br><br>

**🏁 Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how predictive modeling and business intelligence can work together to tackle return management in e-commerce. With proactive insight into high-risk orders, companies can reduce return rates, optimize logistics, and improve customer experience. <br><br>
